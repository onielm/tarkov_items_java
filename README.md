# How to use #

#### How to use .jar
1. Download the latest version of Java https://www.java.com/en/
2. Download the .jar located with the files above
3. Run the .jar
4. "If you doubleclick on a jar file, and your Java application does not start, your .jar association has been hijacked. You can fix the problem with Jarfix." https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html

#### How to use .exe
1. Download the latest version of Java https://www.java.com/en/
2. Download the .exe located with the files above
3. Run the .exe

###### NOTE
A text file named "tarkov_items_data.txt" will be created in the same folder as the .exe or .jar.

The .exe was created by exporting the Eclipse project as an executable .jar, and then the .jar was made to an .exe with launch4j http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/

# TO DO
- Run the jar on my other devices to test it properly...
- Check again the items needed by vendors
- Attribute the 3 downloaded .jar's (commons-io-2.6.jar, json-java.jar, json-simple-1.1.jar)
